    <h1>Varenyky with Cherries</h1>
    <p>Varenyky with cherries take me back to my childhood. It was one of my favorite meals growing up.
    <br>Made only in the summer when the cherries were at their best. It was always a family affair when it came to making varenyky.</p>

    <h2>What is Cherry Varenyky?</h2>
    <p>Cherry varenyky are considered a classic of Ukrainian cuisine.
      <br>Varenyky are half-moon shaped dumplings made with an assortment of fillings, sometimes sweet or savory. 
       Usually boiled in salted water and served commonly with sour cream and sugar on top. </p>

     time to prepare the dough and assemble it.</p>

      <li>all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>cold water</li>

     </ul>

     <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>
     <p>This recipe makes about 45 varenyky. You can enjoy some now and freeze some for later.</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>To make the filling:</strong></li>
       <ol>
        <li>Toss halved and pitted cherries with sugar and let stand at room temperature until cherries release their juices.</li>
      </ol>
     </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To make the dough:</strong></li>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large bowl with a wooden spoon, combine the flour, salt, and water until the dough resembles a shaggy ball. Then, knead the dough until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To cut out the dough:</strong></li>
        <ol>
          <li>Divide the dough into two balls and roll out each ball on a floured surface about 1/4-inch thick. 
              Using a drinking glass or a round cookie cutter, cut out the dough into 3-inch circles.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To assemble the dough:</strong></li>
        <ol>
         <li>
           Place a few halved cherries with syrup into the middle of each circle and seal the circle by pinching two sides together.
           <br>You can leave the varenyky just like that or create a scalloped edge as shown in the image below.
        </li>
             <li>
              Place assembled varenyky on a parchment-lined baking sheet. 
              At this point, you can either cook the varenyky or freeze them.
             </li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>To cook varenyky:</strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add varenyky one at a time. Do not overcrowd.
         Boil for about 5 minutes or until they float to the top. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and serve with homemade 
         cherry compote which I show you how to make in the recipe card below with only two ingredients.</p>
         <p><strong>To freeze varenyky:</strong>Place assembled varenyky on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer 
          without letting them touch each other. Place the baking sheet in a freezer for 1 hour. 
          After varenyky harden, transfer them into a ziplock bag or an airtight container with a lid. Freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
