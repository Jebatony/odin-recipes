          in Eastern Europe, potato pancakes are hugely influential across the continent.</p>

          <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
          <p>To make draniki, you'll first need to assemble the following ingredients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Potatoes</strong> - 6 medium (700 grams total)</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong> - 1 medium</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> - 3 heaped tablespoons</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> - 1 medium white onion</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> - 1 tsp</li>
            <li><strong>Pepper</strong> - 1/2 tsp</li>
            <li><strong>Sunflower Oil</strong> - 4 tbsp</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - 2-3 cloves, optional</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Herbs (dill and parsley)</strong> - handful, optional</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Grate the potatoes and add them to a bowl. In the bowl, add 1 tsp of salt, mixing it in. 
                Leave the mixture for around 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the liquid out of the potatoes with your hands or using a cheesecloth, depending on preference.</li>
            <li>With your potato prepared, grate the onion and add it to the drained potatoes.</li>
            <li>Crack open the egg into a separate bowl, beat the egg, and finally add it to the potato-onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Next, add the black pepper and any additional ingredients you're using, such as minced garlic, dill,
                and parsley.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to the mixture, and mix everything together thoroughly. Once mixed, you should have a batter 
                similar to pancake batter.</li>
            <li>On a pan, over medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. When the oil is shimmering, turn the heat down to medium,
                and add a scoop of batter at a time, forming little potato pancakes. <br>Cook for about 3 minutes on one side 
                until it's brown on the bottom.</li>
            <li>After about 3 minutes, once the draniki are brown on the bottom, flip them to cook on the other side. 
              Turn the heat down to medium-low and cover the pan with a lid, if possible, so that the potato will cook 
              better on the inside. You'll be cooking them for another 3-4 minutes until the potato is cooked inside.</li>
          </ol>
          <center>
            <p>Once the potato pancakes are ready, remove them from the pan and place them on a plate or in a bowl to rest.
               As mentioned above, if you want to want to do as the Ukranians do, use a crockery dish.</p>
           <hr size="3" color="black">
           <p>Sour cream and draniki are a match made in heaven. Ukranians also enjoy this wholesome dish with a side of meat.
             The beauty, however, of draniki is that one pancake alone is packed with goodness and flavor, and is very filling 
             all by itself. <br>However, as this is a potato dish, if you want to get creative your serving options are endless. </p>
